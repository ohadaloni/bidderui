RTB (Real Time Bidder) Architecture & components
------------------------------------------------
Software Stack
	PHP
	MySQL
	Mmecache
also:
	Linux
	Apache
	M - a php framework

Major Components
	Bidder
	Services
	Admin System


Bidder
	The bidder recieves bidRequests from the exchange
	the bidder handles the request by consulting memcache stored information.
	No queries to the database are made while handling a request.
	In statisticaly rare cases,
	a query might still be made and its results stored in memcache.
	The requests travels through a sequece of filters and processors,
	with the final succesful result of producing a bid.
	each step may in turn decide to refuse the request,
	in which case the bidder will send a noBid response.
		method sequence:
			cnt - count the request
			onOff - check that the bidder is turned on
			memcacheSanity - check system loads
			throttle - check speed upper limit
			bidRequest - parse
			geo - verify geo consistency
			bidRequestStats - collect general statistics
			noBidTest - respond to test request
			totalBudget - verify total budget boundary
			spreadBidderEvenly - pacer. also caps dailyBudget
			sanity - can we at all handle this request
			mustMatch - select filtered list of offers that match this request
			throttled - campaigns pacer filter
			ammendClicks - add the number of clicks to the offers
			ammendRpm - add the revenue rpm to the throttled
			offer - select offer
			bidPrice - set the bidPrice



			
Services
	A collection of cron services handle the flow of data between memcache and the DB.
	Services store bidRequest statistics and the activity of the bidder.
	Summaries are produced for quick access by the bidder and the admin system.
	A dimension optimizer analyses the data and caches optimization information.
	Counters are updateed to the database for longer term storage.
		list of Services:
			dimensionCleaner - save queued dimension values
			updater - update counters to DB
			dimensionBlackLister - campaign optimizer
			cleaners - general purpose queue storage
			services - collect admin system report figures
			summarize - aggregate activity history
			gc - garbage collector

Admin System
	Organized as a separate software system,
	this system is a WEB front end to control the bidder.
	It facilitats the creation and modification of campaigns,
	controls campaigns and bidder budgets,
	and provides reports and graphs to show the bidder's activity.
		major components
			control panel -  control the bidder on/off & budgets
			stats - show bidder & campaign metrics
			campaign wizard - create & control individual campaigns
			machine learing - show optimizer activities
			load averages panel -  monitor system loads
			bidder - communicate with the bidder (test suite)
			publisher - simulate ad space publisher page
			exchange - simulate exchange traffic
